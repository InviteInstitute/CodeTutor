# 🧠 TutorVLM: Streamlit Interface for Block-Based Programming Feedback

TutorVLM is an interactive **Visual-Language Tutor** built upon the [InternVL3-14B](https://huggingface.co/OpenGVLab/InternVL3-14B) model.  
It helps students learn **block-based programming** (e.g., Scratch-style code) by assessing their code,  
providing stepwise hints, and answering natural language questions — all through a Streamlit GUI.
